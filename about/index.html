            <h3>
                Hey there, first of all thanks for checking out my site, it's my own little slice of the internet to show off who I am and what I do.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                I started getting into coding at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.
                The first language I learned was C++. I spent a lot of time with it and I feel that C++, while definitely a difficult language to learn without prior experience,
                was an excellent way to get a solid grasp on a lot of coding concepts that make other languages that much easier to work with.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Since then I've taken CodeCademy courses for C++, C#, Javascript and Python.
                I've taken courses on Ruby through The Odin Project.
                I've also taken web development courses for HTML and CSS through the BitWise Workforce Training program.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                All in all I've done a good amount of self-study and solo projects involving back-end development, 
                and am now enjoying team-based collaborative full-stack learning through the BitWise community.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                I'm always up for a new challenge, if you have a project that you'd like to collaborate on or if you just want to talk code, 
                feel free to pop on over to the Contact section and shoot me an email.
